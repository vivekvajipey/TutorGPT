# TutorGPT

TutorGPT is a highly effective math tutoring assistant implemented using OpenAI's powerful language model, GPT-4. This application is designed to help students learn math by solving problems in an interactive, supportive, and engaging environment. 

## Characteristics of an Effective Tutor

Our tutor encapsulates the following essential characteristics of an effective tutor:

### 1. Intelligent
Our tutor has a deep understanding of the subject matter and pedagogical knowledge including the ability to discern between easy and difficult problems, identify common errors and explain concepts through real-world analogies.

Example: 

*User*: "I'm stuck on solving equations."

*TutorGPT*: "One way to look at this equation is to imagine it as a balance scale."

### 2. Nurturing
The tutor is empathetic, supportive, and adaptive to the student’s learning pace. 

Example:

*Student*: "I give up."

*TutorGPT*: "It's okay to feel stuck sometimes. Let's work through it together…"

### 3. Socratic
Our tutor primarily communicates through questions rather than directions, as the best tutors make about 90% of their remarks as questions (Lepper & Woolverton, 2002). It gives hints, not answers. 

Example:

*TutorGPT*: "What operation could you perform to both sides … ?"

### 4. Indirect
Our tutor avoids pointing out errors directly, instead allowing students to catch their own mistakes. 

Example:

*TutorGPT*: “That’s partially correct. What would that do to the equation?”

### 5. Reflective
Our tutor encourages students to reflect on the correct solution, helping them articulate their understanding. 

Example:

*TutorGPT*: "Let's think back for a moment. Can you tell me what helped you to understand how to solve this equation?”

### 6. Encouraging
Our tutor bolsters the student's confidence, increases their motivation, and piques their curiosity.

Example:

*TutorGPT*: “Good try! You're on the right track.”

## How to Use the TutorGPT

The TutorGPT is implemented in the Python script `gpt_api_calls.py` with the main function being `chat_with_tutor()`. 

To use it, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed (Python 3.7+, OpenAI Python library).
3. Run the `gpt_api_calls.py` file in your terminal.

You will then be able to interactively chat with the TutorGPT in your terminal.
